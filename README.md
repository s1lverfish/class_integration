Simple base excalidraw class integration.
The index.tsx file has an ExcalidrawWrapper react class component, and an ExcalidrawObject class which is the default export.

I'm using node: 20.12.2 and yarn: 1.22.22

You can to run `yarn` to download dependencies, then run `yarn build` to create a new build.

Alternatively you can open a terminal in the `example` directory and start the application with `python3 -m http.server` to start a simple http server on `localhost:8000`. You don't need to create a new build for this. If you create a new build, you need to manually move it to the `./example` directory.
